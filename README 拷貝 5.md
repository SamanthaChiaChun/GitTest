To display an Action Sheet that selects a date:

The sample code includes a custom class ActionSheetDatePicker that will be used in this recipe. It contains a custom UIActionSheet implementation that contains a UIDatePicker, UILabel and UIButton.
Create the ActionSheetDatePicker and set the Title:
actionSheetDatePicker = new ActionSheetDatePicker (this.View);
actionSheetDatePicker.Title = "Choose Date:";
Set the type and validation properties of the UIDatePicker property:
actionSheetDatePicker.DatePicker.Mode = UIDatePickerMode.DateAndTime;
actionSheetDatePicker.DatePicker.MinimumDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays (-7);
actionSheetDatePicker.DatePicker.MaximumDate = DateTime.Today.AddDays (7);
Handle the UIDatePicker value changing (in this case, we apply the selected date directly to the UILabel):
actionSheetDatePicker.DatePicker.ValueChanged += (s, e) => {
dateLabel.Text = (s as UIDatePicker).Date.ToString ();
};
In the Choose a date button TouchUpInside handler call Show to display the Action Sheet:
actionSheetDatePicker.Show ();
